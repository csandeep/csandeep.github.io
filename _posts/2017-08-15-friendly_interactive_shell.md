title: Friendly Interactive SHell
---

Continuing my blog theme on repl's whats more appropriate than a blog about shells! Thus far I have been using [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) with [oh my zsh](http://ohmyz.sh). In itself `zsh` is good however it had gotten noticeably slow. I attribute this to the git plugin.

Enter [Friendly Interactive SHell](http://fishshell.com)! In simple words - `fish:zsh::zsh:sh`. 

I no longer need to muck around config files, `fish_config` is a shining example of how CLI applications should handle configuration. Here's a screenshot of fish_config

Combine this with [fisherman](https://fisherman.github.io) you have a very responsive and a very user friendly shell.
